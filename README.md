Overview

The maze game involves navigating a player character from a starting point to an endpoint within a grid-based maze. The player uses keyboard controls (arrow keys) to move around. The maze will have walls that the player cannot pass through, requiring the player to find a path to the exit.

Components
HTML (Structure)

The HTML will define the basic structure of the maze. It will contain a container for the maze grid and a separate container for displaying game information, like a start button or a timer.

CSS (Styling)

CSS will be used to style the maze and the player. Each cell of the maze can be styled as a square, and different classes can be applied to style walls, the player, and the endpoint.

JavaScript (Logic)

JavaScript will handle the game logic, including initializing the maze, handling player movement, checking for collisions with walls, and determining when the player reaches the endpoint.
